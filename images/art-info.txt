If any artists or creators of the images used for this extension want me to exclude a piece of art that they have made, feel free to contact me. My Email and Twitter are on my home page on GitHub.
Additionally, I will do my best to find all of the sources of the art that I can to give them proper credit, but I may miss some or misattribute credit. If anyone wishes to help me credit someone properly by finding the original source of the art or image, I would very much appreciate it.
