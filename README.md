# ShioriNovellafy-Youtube

Enhance your browsing experience with ShioriNovellafy! Is your recommended feed lacking in menhera goth girls? Are you having trouble finding your oshi? An absence of dorkiness in your life? Fear no more. This extension adds famous VTuber Shiori Novella to every YouTube thumbnail.

This is a fork of [MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube), a fantastic extension which deserves all sorts of praise, I just modified it a tiny bit to be Shiori.

Instructions on how to port and modify the extension can be found [on MagicJinn's page](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/issues/16) or in "how-to-upload.txt".
